Sure! Based on the documentation you provided, here's a minimal program using the hands-on-ai package. This example will demonstrate a simple chat interaction using the chat module.

First, ensure you have the package installed:


Now, here's a minimal Python program to get a response from the default chat model:


This program imports the get_response function from the chat module and uses it to get a response to the question "What is the capital of France?". The response is then printed to the console.

If you need more functionality or have a specific use case in mind, feel free to let me know!

It looks like the error is happening because the hands-on-ai package is trying to connect to a local server running on localhost at port 11434, but it can't establish the connection. This is likely because the Ollama server, which is required for local LLM inference, is not running.

Here are some steps to resolve this issue:

Ensure Ollama is Installed and Running:

If you haven't installed Ollama yet, you can do so by following the instructions in the documentation:

Check Ollama Server Status:

Make sure the Ollama server is running. You can check this by running:

If it's not running, start it with:

Verify the Server URL and Port:

Ensure that the server URL and port in your configuration match the running Ollama server. The default should be http://localhost:11434.
Restart Ollama:

Sometimes, simply restarting the Ollama server can resolve connection issues:

Check for Network Issues:

Ensure there are no network issues or firewall settings blocking the connection to localhost:11434.
After following these steps, try running your program again. If you continue to experience issues, please let me know!

What is localost, what is a port 11434 who is Ollama?
Copilot said:
Copilot
Let's break down each of these terms:

Localhost:

localhost refers to the local computer that a program is running on. It's a hostname that means "this computer" and is used to access network services running on the same machine. When you use localhost, you're telling your computer to connect to itself.
The IP address for localhost is 127.0.0.1.
Port 11434:

A port is a communication endpoint that allows different services or applications to communicate over a network. Each port is identified by a number, and different services use different port numbers.
In your case, port 11434 is the specific port number that the Ollama server uses to listen for incoming requests. Think of it as a specific "door" on your computer that the Ollama server is "standing behind," ready to handle requests.
Ollama:

Ollama is a local server that provides large language model (LLM) inference capabilities. It allows you to run AI models on your local machine, which can be useful for tasks like generating text, answering questions, and more.
The hands-on-ai package uses Ollama to perform local LLM inference, meaning it sends requests to the Ollama server to get responses from the AI models.
In summary, your program is trying to connect to the Ollama server running on your local machine (localhost) at port 11434 to perform AI tasks. If the server isn't running or there's a connection issue, you'll see the error you mentioned. Make sure the Ollama server is installed and running to resolve this issue. If you need help with installing or starting Ollama, let me know!

I am running in a notbook... can I connect to a server some how?
Copilot said:
Copilot
Yes, you can connect to a server from a Jupyter notebook. Here are the steps to do so:

Run Jupyter Notebook on the Remote Server:

First, you need to start the Jupyter Notebook on the remote server. You can do this by SSHing into the server and running the following command:

This command starts the Jupyter Notebook server on port 8888 without opening a browser.
Set Up an SSH Tunnel:

On your local machine, you need to set up an SSH tunnel to forward the remote server's port to your local machine. Open a terminal on your local machine and run:

Replace your_username with your username on the remote server and remote_server_ip with the IP address of the remote server.
Access Jupyter Notebook Locally:

Once the SSH tunnel is set up, you can access the Jupyter Notebook running on the remote server by opening a web browser on your local machine and navigating to:
http://localhost:8888
This setup allows you to run your Jupyter Notebook on a powerful remote server while accessing it from your local machine. This can be particularly useful if your local machine doesn't have enough resources to handle large computations.

If you encounter any issues or need further assistance, feel free to ask!

Ummm.. thats no much help, dosn;t make much sense to me.  Is there a way to configure a server.   Og BTW I in a Google Colab notebook
Copilot said:
Copilot
Got it! Since you're using Google Colab, you can configure a server to connect to from within your notebook. Here's how you can set up a remote server for the hands-on-ai package:

Set Up a Remote Server:

You need a remote server where you can run the Ollama server. This could be a cloud VM (like AWS, GCP, or Azure) or any other server you have access to.
Install and Start Ollama on the Remote Server:

SSH into your remote server and install Ollama:

Start the Ollama server:

Expose the Ollama Server to the Internet:

Ensure that the server's firewall allows incoming connections on the port Ollama is using (default is 11434).
You might need to configure your cloud provider's security group or firewall settings to allow traffic on this port.
Get the Public IP Address of Your Server:

Note down the public IP address or domain name of your remote server.
Configure Your Google Colab Notebook to Use the Remote Server:

In your Google Colab notebook, set the server URL to point to your remote server. You can do this by setting the AILABKIT_SERVER environment variable:

Here's a complete example of how you can set this up in your Google Colab notebook:


Replace <your_server_ip> with the actual IP address or domain name of your remote server.

This setup allows your Google Colab notebook to connect to the Ollama server running on your remote server, enabling you to use the hands-on-ai package without running into connection issues.

If you need further assistance or run into any issues, feel free to ask!

How can I use the hands-on-ai package to def parse_weather_question(question):
    """Figure out what the user is asking about the weather      
       Extract location, time period, and what they want to know"
    # use hands-on-ai package here
    pass

To use the hands-on-ai package to parse a weather-related question and extract information such as location, time period, and specific weather details, you can leverage the agent module to create a custom tool for this purpose. Here's a step-by-step guide to achieve this:

Define the Custom Tool:

Create a function that uses the hands-on-ai package to parse the weather question.
Register the Tool with the Agent:
Conversation with MS Copilot 7th May 025

Register the custom tool so that the agent can use it.
Run the Agent with the Custom Tool:

Use the agent to parse the question and extract the required information.
Here's an example implementation:


Explanation:
Custom Tool Definition:

The parse_weather_question function uses regular expressions to extract the location and time period from the question. It also identifies what specific weather detail the user is asking about (e.g., temperature, rain, wind).
Tool Registration:

The register_tool function registers the custom tool with the agent, making it available for use.
Agent Execution:

The run_agent function runs the agent with the custom tool to parse the weather question and extract the required information.
This setup allows you to parse weather-related questions and extract relevant details using the hands-on-ai package. If you have any further questions or need additional functionality, feel free to ask!

Wow... that looks confusing, what is re.  Nevermidn... .  Lets try something with you?  Here is a sentence, can you tell me the location, time_period and weather attribute?

"Is it raining in Perth today?"

Copilot said:
Copilot
Sure, let's break down the sentence: "Is it raining in Perth today?"

Location: Perth
Time Period: Today
Weather Attribute: Raining
So, the sentence is asking about the weather (specifically if it's raining) in Perth for the time period of today. If you have any more questions or need further assistance, feel free to ask!
